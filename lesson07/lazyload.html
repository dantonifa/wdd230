                <h2>Lazy Loading</h2>

                <p>Lazy loading is a technique that defers loading of non-essential resources at page load time. Instead, these non-essential resources are loaded at the moment they are needed. This technique can be used to improve the performance of a web page by reducing the initial load time.</p>

                <p>Lazy loading is especially useful for images that are not visible on the initial screen view. By deferring the loading of these images, the initial page load time can be reduced, which can improve the user experience.</p>

                <p>Lazy loading can be implemented using the <code>loading="lazy"</code> attribute on the <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> element. This attribute tells the browser to defer the loading of the image until it is needed. The browser will then load the image when it comes into view, which can help reduce the initial load time of the page.</p>

                <p>Lazy loading can also be implemented using JavaScript. By monitoring the scroll position of the page, JavaScript can determine when an image is in view and load it at that time. This can be useful for more complex lazy loading scenarios, such as loading images in a gallery as the user scrolls through the page.</p>
